A simple calorie tracking app

While using the conventional calorie tracking apps I couldn't help but notice I needed something much lighter and less feature rich. 
The many features of those apps made them too complicated, considering I only wanted to track calories and a couple of basic macros.
This app uses a fresh custom-made PostgreSQL database instead of an existing one, so it's a bit tailor-made for the user.
